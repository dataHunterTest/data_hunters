Welcome to the data_hunters!

Our role is to collect and cultivate supplemental data sets for use in the `openintro` or `usdata` R packages associated with the OpenIntro textbooks. 

*If you have an ORCID please email it to me - nicholas.paterno@gmail.com - so that it can be included in your credits.

*Be sure to add data sets that are ready to the appropriate tab on the Google Sheets file that we went over during our initial meeting.

FOR THOSE USING R AND GITHUB

1. We will commonly use the `devtools`, `here`, `usethis`, `janitor`,`magrittr`, `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages. If needed, you can install them using the code below:

> install.packages(c("devtools", "here", "usethis", "janitor", "magrittr", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))

The next steps will be a series of three screencasts to walk you through the entire process you'll go through from setting up your GitHub/RStudio link to adding datasets to the package to submitting a pull request to merge your fork with this repo. 

2. The [first screencast](https://youtu.be/sVj9iUd6dGo) will walk you through the process of forking the data_hunter repo and cloning your fork to your computer using the `usethis` package. 
	
3. The [second screencast](https://youtu.be/EMolrLqRNVU) shows you how everything is organized and how to add a dataset to the package. This will include syntax and naming conventions that are required in order for the data to be merged with OpenIntro and/or USData.

4. The [final screencast](https://youtu.be/BV2bsSI8oEs) will show you how to submit a pull request via `usethis` in RStudio and how to keep your repo up to date throughout the process. After we have collectively reached 6 new data sets, I will submit a pull request to `openintro` and/or `usdata` to have the data sets merged into those packages. Note that the `openintro` and `usdata` packages will not necessarily be updated on the CRAN every time we merge with them. 

6. Please DO NOT edit the description or namespace files.
